# Brain

Hate remembering things? Forgetting everything got you down? Well Brain is for you!\
Brain will remember everything for you!\
All you need to add the information to Brain and you can recall it at any time.\
Brain is based off of the [Zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de) method of note taking by creating backlinks between notes.\
Brain is different because of the large amount of customisation it allows for by having the notes stored in html format.\

## Planned features
- Notes can be written/edited in html
- Layout customisation to support multiple users
- User editable custom css
- Create custom templates for notes
- Link map graph view
- Options for things like line numbers on edit page
- Edit and preview window visible at the same time
- Command palette
- Daily notes page to jot down notes over the day so they can later be formatted into actual notes
- Search by tags, keywords and dates
- Links/backlinks for linking multiple notes to each other and allowing for renaming files
